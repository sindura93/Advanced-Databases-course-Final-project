# Advanced-Databases-course-Final-project

**Triangle Counting using MapReduce, project adapted from a paper, “Counting Triangles and the Curse of the Last Reducer” – by Siddharth Suri, Sergei Vassilvitskii**

- project executed under the supervision of Prof. Upendranatha Sharma Chakravarthy (https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/upendranath-chakravarthy)

- Implemented the NodeIterator++ algorithm proposed by the authors in both Sequential and MapReduce models in Python. Made various comparisons on the effect of the number of triangles formed for the UK Accident dataset for various light and weather conditions. Visually represented and concluded which areas of UK are mostly affected by which of light or/and weather conditions using a python-based package called folium.
